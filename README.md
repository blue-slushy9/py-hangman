hangman.py is the actual program, hangman_words.txt is the initial version of the word list I downloaded a website. I then had to reformat the list because each word had a bullet point next to it, which I accomplished using the 'copy' and 'edit' Python scrips that are also here, used open() and a few related methods to do it. Then the files with the '2' prefix are the edited versions of the word list.
